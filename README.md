The goal of the project is to build a log book for my sport club using the technologies I learned in the class. 

In this repo you will find the source code of the streamlit app, big queries of data processing on GCP and the micro python code on the IoT device. 

To launch the app simply click this url link of the streamlit app https://exmokapress-streamlit-app-streamlit-app-0y4qi2.streamlit.app/
You can look up members and boats based on the table xx. 

In addition you will find a video recording and an article which demonstrates the streamlit app and wraps up a couple of technical thoughts on this project.
